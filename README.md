# React render to markdown
> Write markdown with React


## Introduction

This renderer allows you to write react and have it render out to a markdown file.


## Why

Markdown felt like good target for my first renderer:
- Only need to work with strings
- Limited API




## Running The project

``` bash

git clone https://github.com/George-Payne/react-render-to-markdown
cd react-render-to-markdown
yarn install
yarn example

```
This will create this readme. Edit  ```demo.js```  to edit the readme.
